===============================

1. Running the app

For running the game you have to open the "index.html"

2. Game Rules

The game rules are pretty simple, if you hit the river you gain score, by the time the player is in a level higher than than 7 the enemies start to die and desapear from the screen, and the number of dead enemies is added to your score.

The player has 10 lives and it can play for infinte levels if still has lives. If lives hit 0 the game is restared (level, lives and score).

After the level 10 you get in a new stage, the hell stage contains burnt grass, grey floor and a blood river, also the enemies are faster, devil.

After each level the speed and quantity of enemies raise and the game offers more challenge.

Achievements are unlocked and shown in the screen as the player passes levels, they are:

	* Level higher or equals 10 the achievement is "WELCOME TO HELL";
	* Level higher or equals 15 the achievement is "IMPRESSIVE COMBO";
	* Level higher or equals 25 the achievement is "HELL MASTER";
	* Level higher or equals 35 the achievement is "OMG!";

The player moves in the screen using the pointer keys "up", "down", "left", "right".
